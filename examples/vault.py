# Example code to retrieve records in a shared folder.
# Usage:
#    python vault.py

import os
import sys
from typing import Optional, Set

from keepercommander import api, record, vault, shared_folder, subfolder
from keepercommander.__main__ import get_params_from_config

# load configuration file.
my_params = get_params_from_config(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'config.json'))

# Prompt for Keeper username if configuration file is empty

api.sync_down(my_params)

# Keeper supports several record formats internally
# Version 2 or Legacy or General records, V2
# Version 3 or Typed records, V3
# Version 4 or File records, V4
# ...
# Record versions 3 and up replace legacy v2 record format

# Commander has 2 class sets for Keeper records
# 1. "Record" class in the record.py
#    This class represents V2 records originally.
#    When used with V3 records it maps V3 record fields to V2 data structure.
#    Convenient when reading records
#    Use api.get_record(param, record_uid) method to load record
# 2. Newer record classes in the vault.py
#    "KeeperRecord" the base class for all record types
#    "PasswordRecord" represents V2 or legacy records
#    "TypedRecord" - V3 or typed records
#    "FileRecord" - V4 or file attachment
#    Use vault.KeeperRecord.load(params, record_uid) to load a record

# Old record class example
# Enumerated all records in all shared folders.
# Shared folders are stored in "shared_folder_cache" attribute of KeeperParams object
