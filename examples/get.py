# Example code to retrieve the password for a record
# stored in the vault.  
# 
# This example shows how to get the record from UID
# or from the full path.  For example:
# 
# By UID:
# -----------
# $ python get.py 
# User(Email): mydemo@company.com
# Master Password: *******
# Enter record UID or full record path: InS1KiJBf1XGK16itcLnyA
#
# By Path:
# -----------
# $ python get.py 
# User(Email): mydemo@company.com
# Master Password: *******
# Enter record UID or full record path: Docs/Customer Data/Hubspot
#
# This code also pulls configuration
# from config.json or writes the config file if it does not exist.
#
# Usage:
#    python get.py
