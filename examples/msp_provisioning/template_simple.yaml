mc:
  name: "TEST Client Corp"
  plan: "enterprisePlus"
  seats: -1

  # Optional: Create a dedicated node for this MC (MSP-side)
  node: "Test Clients"           # Node name where MC will be created
  create_node: true               # Auto-create node if it doesn't exist

  # Optional: Create internal organizational nodes within the MC
  # internal_nodes:
  #   - "Department A"           # For organizing users/folders by department
  #   - "Department B"

  # Root folder - Creates a single MC root folder containing all subfolders
  # Default: MC name (e.g., "TEST Client Corp" folder)
  # Set to "" or false to create folders directly in vault root (no root folder)
  root_folder: "TEST Client Corp"

  # Folder prefix - Prefixes subfolder names so MSP techs know which client when folders are shared
  # Default: first word of MC name (e.g., "TEST" → "TEST-Accounting", "TEST-HR")
  # Set to "" or false to disable prefix
  # Result: "TEST Client Corp/TEST-Accounting", "TEST Client Corp/TEST-HR", etc.
  folder_prefix: "TEST"

  # Optional: Color for the root folder
  # root_folder_color: "blue"

  # Note: Root folder is a regular folder (not shared) to allow shared subfolders inside
  # Individual subfolders can be shared with MSP users using the 'share_with' parameter
