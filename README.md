### Password Management SDK for IT Admins & Developers

Keeper Security develops the world's most downloaded password manager and encrypted digital vault with millions of individual customers and thousands of enterprise customers worldwide.  Keeper is a zero-knowledge, native and cloud-based solution available on every mobile and desktop device platform. <a href="#about-keeper">Read more</a> about Keeper or visit the [Keeper Security](https://keepersecurity.com) website.

Keeper Commander is a command-line, interactive shell and SDK interface to [Keeper&reg; Password Manager](https://keepersecurity.com). Commander can be used to access and control your Keeper vault, rotate passwords and perform Keeper Enterprise administrative functions related to user onboarding and provisioning of vault records. Most features available in the Keeper Admin Console are available through Commander's interactive shell and SDK interface.

In addition to vault and administrative functionality, Commander can be used to perform targeted password rotations, integrate password management into your backend systems and eliminate the use of hardcoded passwords. Using our connector [plugins](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/Commander/tree/master/keepercommander/plugins), Commander can execute a password rotation directly to any common system or service account such as Unix systems, SQL Databases, Active Directory, Amazon AWS, local Administator accounts, network devices, etc...

Keeper Commander is an open source project written in Python, and it is under continuous development by the Keeper engineering team. As new features and capabilities are added to the Keeper platform, we add new commands and features to Commander.  If you need any assistance or require specific functionality, please contact commander@keepersecurity.com.

### Use Cases

* Access your Keeper vault through a command-line interface
* Perform bulk import and export of vault records 
* Manage records, folders and shared folders
* Customize integration into your backend systems
* Provision new Enterprise user accounts and shared folders
* Manage nodes, roles, teams and users
* Rotate passwords on service accounts or other targets
* Integrate Keeper into your existing backend systems
* Schedule and automate commands

### Installation - Linux and Mac

1. Get Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org).
2. Install Keeper Commander with pip3:

```bash
$ pip3 install keepercommander
```

Important: Restart your terminal session after installation

### Install Keepass library

If you plan to use the Keepass import or export features of Keeper Commander, please follow [these instructions](keepercommander/importer/keepass/README.md).

### Upgrading to Latest Code

```bash
$ pip3 install --upgrade keepercommander
```

Please do not upgrade a production system without validation in your test environment as commands and functionality is under rapid development.

### Developer Setup

This type of installation assumes you want to view/modify the Python source code (Compatible with Python 3.4+).

1. Clone/Download the Commander repository 
2. Install Python3 from python.org
3. Install virtualenv:
```bash
$ sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```
4. Create and activate the virtual environment for your keeper project:

### Importing Records into Keeper

To import records into your vault, use the ```import``` command.  Supported import formats:

* JSON
* CSV 
* Keepass

JSON import files can contain records, folders, subfolders, shared folders, default folder permissions  and user/team permissions.
CSV import files contain records, folders, subfolders, shared folders and default shared folder permissions.
Keepass files will transfer records, file attachments, folders and subfolders. Option exists to make all folders as shared folders. File attachments are supported in both import and export with Keepass however they are limited to 1MB for each file based on keepass' structure.

**JSON Record Import**

Below is a JSON import file with 2 records. The first record is added to a folder called "My Servers". The second record is added to "My Servers" and also added to a shared folder called "Shared Servers". 

The import file example below is an array of record objects which can import into private folders and shared folders:

```bash
[{
    "title":"Dev Server",
    "folders": [
      {
        "folder": "My Servers"
      }
    ],
    "login": "root",
    "password": "lk4j139sk4j",
    "login_url": "https://myserver.com",
    "notes": "These are some notes.",
    "custom_fields": {"Security Group":"Private"}
},
{
    "title":"Prod Server",
    "folders": [
      {
        "folder": "My Servers"
      },
      {
       "shared_folder": "Shared Servers",
       "can_edit": true,
       "can_share": true
      }
    ],
    "login": "root",
    "password": "kj424094fsdjhfs4jf7h",
    "login_url": "https://myprodserver.com",
    "notes": "These are some notes.",
    "custom_fields": {"Security Group":"Public","IP Address":"12.45.67.8"}
}]
```

Another example below first creates shared folders that are shared to users and teams, then imports records into the shared folders.  The format of the file is slightly different and allows you to separate the creation of shared folder objects and records:


```
{
  "shared_folders": [
    {
      "path": "My Customer 1",
      "manage_users": true,
      "manage_records": true,
      "can_edit": true,
      "can_share": true,
      "permissions": [
        {
          "uid": "kVM96KGEoGxhskZoSTd_jw",
          "manage_users": true,
          "manage_records": true
        },
        {
          "name": "user@mycompany.com",
          "manage_users": true,
          "manage_records": true
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "path": "Testing\\My Customer 2",
      "manage_users": true,
      "manage_records": true,
      "can_edit": true,
      "can_share": true,
      "permissions": [
        {
          "uid": "ih1CggiQ-3ENXcn4G0sl-g",
          "manage_users": true,
          "manage_records": true
        },
        {
          "name": "user@mycompany.com",
          "manage_users": true,
          "manage_records": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "records": [
    {
      "title": "Bank Account 1",
      "login": "customer1234",
      "password": "4813fJDHF4239fdk",
      "login_url": "https://chase.com",
      "notes": "These are some notes.",
      "custom_fields": {
        "Account Number": "123-456-789"
      },
      "folders": [
        {
          "folder": "Optional Private Folder 1"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Bank Account 2",
      "login": "mybankusername",
      "password": "w4k4k193f$^&@#*%2",
      "login_url": "https://amex.com",
      "notes": "Some great information here.",
      "custom_fields": {
        "Security Group": "Public",
        "IP Address": "12.45.67.8"
      },
      "folders": [
        {
          "folder": "Optional Private Folder 1"
        },
        {
          "shared_folder": "My Customer 1",
          "can_edit": true,
          "can_share": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The format must be strict JSON or it will fail parsing. To import this file:

```bash
$ keeper import --format=json import.json
```

There are more complex import file examples that supports shared folders, folder permissions, user permissions and team permissions located in the sample_data/ folder. To import the sample JSON file into your vault, type this command:

* Example 1: [import.json.txt](sample_data/import.json.txt)
* Example 2: [import_records_existing_folders.json.txt](sample_data/import_records_existing_folders.json.txt)
* Example 3: [import_records_into_folders.json.txt](sample_data/import_records_into_folders.json.txt)
* Example 4: [import_shared_folders.json.txt](sample_data/import_shared_folders.json.txt)
* Example 5: [import_shared_folders_and_records.json.txt](sample_data/import_shared_folders_and_records.json.txt)

```bash
$ keeper import --format=json sample_data/import.json.txt
```

The sample file contains "permissions" objects that contain email address or team names.  If the email or team name exists in your Keeper enterprise account, they will be added to the shared folder, otherwise the information is ignored. 


**CSV Record Import**

Keeper supports .csv text file import using comma delimited fields.

File Format:
Folder,Title,Login,Password,Website Address,Notes,Shared Folder,Custom Fields

* To specify subfolders, use backslash "\\" between folder names
* To set shared folder permission on the record, use the #edit or #reshare tags as seen below 
* Enclose fields in quotes for multi-line or special characters
* Ensure files are UTF-8 encoded for support of international or double-byte characters 

Below is an example csv file that showcases several import features including personal folders, shared folders, subfolders, special characters and multi-line fields.

```

```

To import this file:
```bash
$ keeper import --format=csv test.csv
4 records imported successfully
```

The resulting vault will look like [this image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Keeper-Security/Commander/master/keepercommander/images/csv_import.png)

**Keepass Import**

Keeper supports importing the record and folder structure directly from an encrypted Keepass file. File attachments are also supported (up to 1MB per file).  Make sure to first follow [these instructions](keepercommander/importer/keepass/README.md) to install the necessary keepass modules.

```bash
$ keeper import --format=keepass test.kdbx
```

You can optionally make all top level folders as shared folder object with default permissions.

```bash
$ keeper import --format=keepass --shared --permissions=URES test.kdbx
```

For more options, see the help screen:
```bash
$ keeper import -h
```

### Ad-Hoc Event Reporting 

Business customers can now generate advanced ad-hoc event reports with over 100 different event types and custom filters. For help with the syntax of the report, use the below command:

```
My Vault> audit-report --syntax-help                                                                                                                                                                        
```

### Event Logging to SIEM

Commander supports integration with popular SIEM solutions such as Splunk, Sumo and general Syslog format.  For more general reporting of events, we recommend using the ```audit-report``` command.  For pushes of event data into on-prem SIEM, the ```audit-log``` command is a good choice because it automatically tracks the last event exported and only sends incremental updates.  The list of over 100 event types is documented in our Enterprise Guide:

[https://docs.keeper.io/enterprise-guide/event-reporting](https://docs.keeper.io/enterprise-guide/event-reporting)

Using Commander for SIEM integration works well in an on-prem environment where the HTTP event collector is only available within your network.  The Keeper Admin Console versino 13.3+ is capable of integrating our backend event data into your SIEM solution but it requires that you are utilizing a cloud-based SIEM solution. If you need assistance in integrating Keeper into your SIEM solution without Commander, please contact our business support team at business.support@keepersecurity.com. 

**Export of Event Logs in Syslog Format**

Commander can export all event logs to a local file in syslog format, or export data in incremental files.  A Keeper record in your vault
is used to store a reference to the last event  

```bash
$ keeper shell
```

To export all events and start tracking the last event time exported:

```
My Vault> audit-log --target=syslog
Do you want to create a Keeper record to store audit log settings? [y/n]: y
Choose the title for audit log record [Default: Audit Log: Syslog]: 
Enter filename for syslog messages.
...              Syslog file name: all_events.log
...          Gzip messages? (y/N): n
Exported 3952 audit events
My Vault>
```

This creates a record in your vault (titled "Audit Log: Syslog" in this example) which tracks the timestamp of the last exported event and the output filename.
Then the event data is exported to the file in either text or gzip format.

Each subsequent audit log export can be performed with this command:

```bash
$ keeper audit-log --format=syslog --record=<your record UID>
```
or from the shell:

```
My Vault> audit-log --target=syslog --record=<your record UID>
```

To automate the syslog event export every 5 minutes, create a JSON configuration file such as this:

```bash
{
    "server":"https://keepersecurity.com/api/v2/",
    "user":"craig@company.com",
    "password":"your_password_here",
    "mfa_token":"filled_in_by_commander",
    "mfa_type":"device_token",
    "debug":false,
    "plugins":[],
    "commands":["sync-down","audit-log --target=syslog"],
    "timedelay":600,
}
```

Then run Commander using the config parameter. For example:

```bash
$ keeper --config=my_config_file.json
```


**Splunk HTTP Event Collector Push**

Keeper can post event logs directly to your on-prem or cloud Splunk instance. Please follow the below steps:

* Login to Splunk enterprise 
* Go to Settings -> Data Inputs -> HTTP Event Collector
* Click on "New Token" then type in a name, select an index and finish.
* At the last step, copy the "Token Value" and save it for the next step.
* Login to Keeper Commander shell

```bash
$ keeper shell
```

Next set up the Splunk integration with Commander. Commander will create a record in your vault that stores the provided token and Splunk HTTP Event Collector. This will be used to also track the last event captured so that subsequent execution will pick up where it left off.  Note that the default port for HEC is 8088.

```
$ keeper audit-log --format=splunk

Do you want to create a Keeper record to store audit log settings? [y/n]: y
Choose the title for audit log record [Default: Audit Log: Splunk]: <enter> 

Enter HTTP Event Collector (HEC) endpoint in format [host:port].
Example: splunk.company.com:8088
...           Splunk HEC endpoint: 192.168.51.41:8088
Testing 'https://192.168.51.41:8088/services/collector' ...Found.
...                  Splunk Token: e2449233-4hfe-4449-912c-4923kjf599de
```
You can find the record UID of the Splunk record for subsequent audit log exports:

```
My Vault> search splunk

  #  Record UID              Title              Login    URL
---  ----------------------  -----------------  -------  -----
  1  schQd2fOWwNchuSsDEXfEg  Audit Log: Splunk
```

Each subsequent audit log export can be performed with this command:

```bash
$ keeper audit-log --format=splunk --record=<your record UID>
```
or from the shell:

```
My Vault> audit-log --target=splunk --record=<your record UID>
```

To automate the push of Splunk events every 5 minutes, create a JSON configuration file such as this:

```bash
{
    "server":"https://keepersecurity.com/api/v2/",
    "user":"craig@company.com",
    "password":"your_password_here",
    "mfa_token":"filled_in_by_commander",
    "mfa_type":"device_token",
    "debug":false,
    "plugins":[],
    "commands":["sync-down","audit-log --target=splunk"],
    "timedelay":600,
}
```

Then run Commander using the config parameter. For example:

```bash
$ keeper --config=my_config_file.json
```


**Sumo Logic HTTP Event Collector Push**

Keeper can post event logs directly to your Sumo Logic account. Please follow the below steps:

* Login to Sumo Logic
* Go to Manage Data -> Collection 
* Click on Add Collector -> Hosted Collector then Add Source -> HTTP Logs & Metrics 
* Name the collector and Save. Any other fields are default.
* Note the HTTP Source Address which is the collector URL  
* Login to Keeper Commander shell

```bash
$ keeper shell
```

Next set up the Sumo Logic integration with Commander. Commander will create a record in your vault that stores the HTTP Collector information. This will be used to also track the last event captured so that subsequent execution will pick up where it left off.

```
$ keeper audit-log --format=sumo
```

When asked for “HTTP Collector URL:” paste the URL captured from the Sumo interface above.

After this step, there will be a record in your vault used for tracking the event data integration.
You can find the record UID of the Sumo record for subsequent audit log exports:

```
My Vault> search sumo

  #  Record UID              Title              Login    URL
---  ----------------------  -----------------  -------  -----
  1  schQd2fOWwNchuSsDEXfEg  Audit Log: Sumo
```

Each subsequent audit log export can be performed with this command:

```bash
$ keeper audit-log --format=sumo --record=<your record UID>
```
or from the shell:

```
My Vault> audit-log --target=sumo --record=<your record UID>
```

To automate the push of Sumo Logic events every 5 minutes, create a JSON configuration file such as this:

```bash
{
    "server":"https://keepersecurity.com/api/v2/",
    "user":"craig@company.com",
    "password":"your_password_here",
    "mfa_token":"filled_in_by_commander",
    "mfa_type":"device_token",
    "debug":false,
    "plugins":[],
    "commands":["sync-down","audit-log --target=sumo"],
    "timedelay":600,
}
```

Then run Commander using the config parameter. For example:

```bash
$ keeper --config=my_config_file.json
```

**Azure Log Analytics**

Keeper can post event logs directly to your Azure Log Analytics workspace. Please follow the below steps:

* Login to Azure Portal and open Log Analytics workspace
* Go to Settings -> Advanced settings
* Note the Workspace ID and Primary or Secondary key
* Login to Keeper Commander shell

```bash
$ keeper shell
```

Next set up the Log Analytics integration with Commander. Commander will create a record in your vault that stores the Log Analytics access information. This will be used to also track the last event captured so that subsequent execution will pick up where it left off.

```
$ keeper audit-log --format=log-analytics
```

When asked for “Workspace ID:” paste Workspace ID captured from the Advanced settings interface above.
When asked for “Key:” paste Primary or Secondary key captured from the Advanced settings interface above.

After this step, there will be a record in your vault used for tracking the event data integration.
You can find the record UID of the Log Analytics record for subsequent audit log exports:

```
My Vault> search analytics

  #  Record UID              Title                           Login                                 URL
---  ----------------------  ------------------------------  ------------------------------------  -----
  1  schQd2fOWwNchuSsDEXfEg  Audit Log: Azure Log Analytics  c66ce97c-3f36-4daa-9138-0fb85483acd3
```

Each subsequent audit log export can be performed with this command:

```bash
$ keeper audit-log --format=log-analytics --record=<your record UID>
```
or from the shell:

```
My Vault> audit-log --target=log-analytics --record=<your record UID>
```

To automate the push of events to Azure Log Analytics every 5 minutes, create a JSON configuration file such as this:

```bash
{
    "server":"https://keepersecurity.com/api/v2/",
    "user":"craig@company.com",
    "password":"your_password_here",
    "mfa_token":"filled_in_by_commander",
    "mfa_type":"device_token",
    "debug":false,
    "plugins":[],
    "commands":["sync-down","audit-log --target=log-analytics"],
    "timedelay":600,
}
```

Then run Commander using the config parameter. For example:

```bash
$ keeper --config=my_config_file.json
```


### Advanced Configuration File

By default, Keeper will look for a file called ```config.json``` in the current working directory and it will use this file for reading and writing session parameters. For example, if you login with two factor authentication, the device token is written to this file. The configuration file loaded can also be customized through the ```config``` parameter. The config file can also be used to automate and schedule commands.

Below is a fully loaded config file. 

```bash
{
    "server":"https://keepersecurity.com/api/v2/",
    "user":"craig@company.com",
    "password":"your_password_here",
    "mfa_token":"filled_in_by_commander",
    "mfa_type":"device_token",
    "debug":false,
    "plugins":[],
    "commands":[],
    "timedelay":0,
}
```

Notes:

* ```server``` can be left blank and defaults to the United States data center. If your account is in the European data center then change the server domain from ```.com``` to ```.eu```.

* ```mfa_token``` will be set by Commander automatically after successful two-factor authentication.

* ```debug``` parameter can be set to ```true``` or ```false``` to enable detailed crypto and network logging.

* ```plugins``` parameter determines which password rotation plugin will be loaded. [Learn more](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/Commander/tree/master/keepercommander/plugins) about password rotation plugins for Commander.

* ```commands``` parameter is a comma-separated list of Keeper commands to run.  For example:
```"commands":["sync-down", "upload-attachment --file=\"/Users/craig/something.zip\" \"3PMqasi9hohmyLWJkgxCWg\"","share-record --email=\"somebody@gmail.com\" --write \"3PMqasi9hohmyLWJkgxCWg\""]``` will sync your vault, upload a file and then share the record with another user.

* ```timedelay``` parameter can be used to automatically run the specified commands every X seconds. For example:
```"timedelay":600``` will run the commands every 10 minutes.

* ```challenge``` parameter is the challenge phrase when using a Yubikey device to authenticate. 

To configure Yubikey device authentication, follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/Commander/tree/master/keepercommander/yubikey).  In this mode, you will use a challenge phrase to authenticate instead of a master password.

* ```device_token_expiration``` can be set to ```true``` to expire 2FA device tokens after 30 days. By default, the 2FA device token will never expire. To manually force a 2FA token to expire, login to your Keeper vault (on desktop app, Web Vault or mobile app) and disable then re-enable your Two-Factor Authentication settings. This will invalidate all previously saved tokens across all devices.

### Batch Mode 

You can batch execute a series of commands and pipe the file to STDIN of Commander.  For example, create a text file called ```test.cmd``` with the following lines:

```
add --login=blah@gmail.com --pass=somemasterpass --url=https://google.com --force "Some Record Title"
upload-attachment --file="/path/to/some/file.txt" "Some Record Title"
share-record --email="user@company.com" --write "Some Record Title"
```

To run this file in a batch mode:
```bash
cat test.cmd | keeper --batch-mode shell
```

### Enterprise SSO Login

Customers who normally login to their Keeper Vault using Enterprise SSO Login (SAML 2.0) can also login to Keeper Commander using a Master Password.  To make use of this capability, it must be enabled by the Keeper Administrator and then configured by the user.  The steps are below:

1. Login to the Admin Console
[https://keepersecurity.com/console](https://keepersecurity.com/console)

2. For the User/Role who will be accessing Keeper Commander, open the Role Enforcement Policy setting screen.

3. Enable the option "Allow users who login with SSO to create a Master Password"

4. Login to the End-User Vault using SSO at [https://keepersecurity.com/vault](https://keepersecurity.com/vault) 

5. Visit the Settings > General screen and setup a Master Password

After the Master Password is created, you are now able to login to Keeper Commander.

### Targeted Password Rotations & Plugins 

Keeper Commander can communicate to internal and external systems for the purpose of rotating a password and synchronizing the change to your Keeper Vault.  We accomplish this by associating a Keeper record with a physical system through the use of custom fields.  For example, you might want to rotate your MySQL password, Active Directory password and local Administrator password automatically.  To support a plugin, simply add a set of **custom field** values to the Keeper record. The custom field values tell Commander which plugin to use, and what system to communicate with when rotating the password.  To modify your Keeper record to include custom fields, login to Keeper on the [Web Vault](https://keepersecurity.com/vault) or [Keeper Desktop](https://keepersecurity.com/download.html) app.  

Example custom fields for MySQL password rotation:

```
Name: cmdr:plugin
Value: mysql

Name: cmdr:host
Value: 192.168.1.55

Name: cmdr:db
Value: testing
```

When a plugin is specified in a record, Commander will search in the plugins/ folder to load the module based on the name provided (e.g. mysql.py) then it will use the values of the Keeper record to connect, rotate the password and save the resulting data.

Check out the [plugins folder](https://github.com/Keeper-Security/Commander/tree/master/keepercommander/plugins) for all of the available plugins.  Keeper's team adds new plugins on an ongoing basis. If you need a particular plugin created, send us an email to commander@keepersecurity.com.

### Locating the Record UID and other Identifiers 

The Record UID and Shared Folder UID can be found either through the "get", "list", "ls -l" or "search" commands, or through the Web Vault user interface.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Keeper-Security/Commander/master/keepercommander/images/record_uid.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Keeper-Security/Commander/master/keepercommander/images/shared_folder_uid.png)

### Deep linking to records (Web Vault Hyperlink)

The Record UID that is displayed on password record output can be used for deep linking directly into the Keeper Web Vault only for privileged users. This Vault link can be stored and sent over unsecure channels because it only provides a reference to the record within your vault -- it does not provide access to the actual record content.  To access the content, you must still authenticate into the vault and decrypt the data.  The link is in the format `https://keepersecurity.com/vault#detail/XXXXXX` and you simply replace XXXXXX with the Record UID. Providing this link to another user does NOT initiate sharing.  To share a vault record, you must authenticate to your vault, open the record and click the "Share" feature.

### About Our Security

Keeper is a zero-knowledge platform.  This means that the server does not have access to your Keeper Master Password or the crypto keys used to encrypt and decrypt your data.  The cryptography is performed on the *client device* (e.g. iPhone, Android, Desktop, Commander).

When you create a Keeper account from our [web app](https://keepersecurity.com/vault) or [mobile/desktop app](https://keepersecurity.com/download), you are asked to create a Master Password and a security question.  The Keeper app creates your crypto keys, RSA keys and encryption parameters (iv, salt, iterations).  Your RSA private key is encrypted with your data key, and your data key is encrypted with your Master Password.  The encrypted version of your data key is stored in Keeper's Cloud Security Vault and provided to you after successful device authentication.

When you login to Keeper on any device (or on Commander), your Master Password is used to derive a 256-bit PBKDF2 key.  This key is used to decrypt your data key.  The data key is used to decrypt individual record keys, shared folder keys and team keys.  Record keys, shared folder keys and team keys are then used to decrypt each individual record in the vault.

When storing information to your vault, Keeper stores and synchronizes the encrypted data.

We strongly recommend that you enable Two-Factor Authentication on your Keeper account via the [web app](https://keepersecurity.com/vault) settings screen.  This can also be enforced at the Keeper Enterprise level. When logging into Commander with Two-Factor Authentication turned on, you will be asked for a one-time passcode.  After successful authentication, Commander receives a device token that can be used for subsequent requests without another two-factor auth request.
