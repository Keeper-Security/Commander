manage your stored Keeper content.  Keeper Commander is a zero-knowledge

create, customize and manage content in their vault.

Use Cases

Command-line Vault Access

Commander can be instantiated from a terminal session via SSH or local.  
Quick access to frequently used data or updates can be performed without 
a user interface.  Any information that the named user has access to 
will be available for access via the Commander interface.  
This includes shared records and shared folders.

Password Reset

Commander can be configured to modify a particular password record 
(such as generating a new randomized password) and synchronize those changes 
to all users with access.  For example, your Active Directory or MySQL database 
password can be rotated daily and shared to privileged users.
