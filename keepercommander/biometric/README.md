# Biometric Authentication

## Secure Authentication with Platform Biometrics for Keeper Commander

The Biometric Authentication module for Keeper Commander enables users to authenticate using platform-specific biometric methods such as Windows Hello and Touch ID. This module provides a secure, convenient alternative to password-based authentication while maintaining the highest security standards through FIDO2/WebAuthn protocols.

### Core Functionality

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows Hello and Touch ID integration 
- **WebAuthn Protocol**: FIDO2-compliant authentication implementation  
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Platform-native secure storage (Windows Hello, macOS Keychain) 
- **Device Trust Management**: Required device registration for security   
- **Credential Lifecycle**: Complete registration, verification, and removal workflows 
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Prerequisites

### OS-Level Biometric Setup

**Before using biometric authentication with Keeper Commander, you must have biometric credentials already configured in your operating system:**

#### Windows Requirements:
- **Windows 11** (required for biometric authentication support)
- **Windows Hello must be set up** in Windows Settings
- Navigate to: `Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options > Windows Hello`
- Configure at least one of:
  - **Face recognition**: Set up Windows Hello Face
  - **Fingerprint**: Set up Windows Hello Fingerprint
  - **PIN**: Required as a backup authentication method
- Hardware requirements:
  - Compatible biometric hardware (fingerprint reader, IR camera, etc.)

#### macOS Requirements:
- **Touch ID must be enabled** in System Preferences
- Navigate to: `System Preferences > Touch ID & Password`
- Add your fingerprint(s) to the system
- Hardware requirements:
  - Mac with Touch ID sensor (MacBook Pro 2016+, MacBook Air 2018+, iMac with Touch ID, etc.)

### Software Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install cbor2 pyobjc-framework-LocalAuthentication fido2
```

---

## Usage

### Initial Setup Process

#### 1. Biometric Registration

Register your biometric credentials with Keeper (requires initial login with your Master password):

```bash
# First, log in to Keeper Commander
keeper shell

# Register biometric authentication
biometric register
```

You'll be prompted to:
- Complete biometric authentication (Touch ID/Windows Hello)
- Provide a friendly name for the credential (optional)

Example with custom settings:

```bash
biometric register --name "My MacBook"
```

#### 2. Device Registration (Mandatory)

**Device registration is required before biometric authentication can be used:**

```bash
# Register your device with Keeper (mandatory step)
this-device register
```

**Why Device Registration is Required:**
- Biometric authentication requires a trusted device relationship
- The device must be approved by Keeper's security system
- Without device registration, biometric login will fall back to default authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Authentication failed" Error

**Possible Causes:**
- Biometric sensors are dirty or obstructed
- OS-level biometric credentials need re-enrollment
- Hardware compatibility issues

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Re-register biometric authentication
biometric unregister --confirm
biometric register

# Verify OS biometric setup is working
# Windows: Test Windows Hello in Settings
# macOS: Test Touch ID in System Preferences
```

#### "No biometric hardware detected" Error

**Windows Solutions:**
```bash
# Check Windows Hello setup status
# Navigate to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options > Windows Hello

# Verify biometric enrollment
# Check if Face recognition or Fingerprint is set up
# Ensure at least PIN is configured as backup

# Install FIDO2 libraries if missing
pip install fido2
```

**macOS Solutions:**
```bash
# Check Touch ID setup comprehensively
# Navigate to System Preferences > Touch ID & Password

# Install required dependencies
pip install cbor2 pyobjc-framework-LocalAuthentication

# Test Touch ID detection manually
bioutil -r -s
```

#### "Password prompt after biometric" Issue

**Cause:** Device not registered with Keeper

**Solution:**
```bash
# Register device first (mandatory step)
this-device register

# Then try biometric authentication
biometric verify
```

#### "Credential already exists" Error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Remove existing credential first
biometric unregister --confirm

# Register new credential
biometric register
```
